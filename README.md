## What it is?

minimail attempts to be the email client that I want. Without clutter and
useless stuff.

It only handles plain text but shows it in a "pretty" way if it's markdown.

You will be able to:

* Login
* Read
* Write
* Archive

And that's it. No image rendering from your spam friendly company. No colors, no
embeded video. Just text.

## What it is NOT?

It's not an email client for everyone just for people who value their time and
content over noise.

## But my grandma does not read Markdown and her Hotmail account it's now called Live and...

Sorry. There's a gazillion other email clients out there.
